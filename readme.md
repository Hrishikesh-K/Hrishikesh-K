# Hi!

I'm not a person of a lot of words and have received mixed feedback about me being direct and to-the-point over the years. Sometimes, it works well, other times, it doesn't.So, this might not be the best readme you'll go across - but hey, I don't do this daily!

For a basic introduction, I'm Hrishikesh Kokate. 2000s kid, based in Mumbai, India currently working as Support Engineer at Netlify. I've been overly fond of computers since my early years and that is part of the reason how I ended up in Netlify.

I have been an introvert (kinda) for a lot of years, but that seems to be changing. So maybe if we meet now, I might be able to talk much more than I'd have been able to do a few years ago. But that's the reason, I ended up relying on writing as my primary means of communication. I still believe this is one of the best forms of communication for a lot of reasons.

## Professionally,

Netlify has been my first real job, so I don't have a lot of career history to share. But, I did find my way around some freelance jobs before. Academically, I'm currently pursuing my final planned degree - Masters. I feel like stopping there at the moment, can't say about the future.

## Personally,

I have developed interest in computers over a long stretch of years. From starting to use computers to make school presentations, to learning animation, audio/video editing, game development, animation and web development as a few major things that I do better than average, my journey with computers has been interesting. I love to experiment, research and learn about the unknowns and find the answer to a lot of `wh` questions. Apart from computers, I enjoy playing a variety of sports and hanging out with a specific set of people.

## Working Style

I believe I'm a reliable person, overall. I am pretty punctual and adhere to deadlines and professionalism in a work environment. I try to stay as organised as possible and it kind of annoys me when I'm working as a team and the other member is not as organised. I try to let it go, but if I end up working on a file from them, I'd spend some time polishing it first before actually starting to work.

As said before, I prefer written communication, but I'm in no way limited to that. I am almost always available for pairing and discussing something together. I tend to reply to messages and notifications as they arrive. Basically, I treat almost every direct message or a mention as an escalation and action it almost immediately.

When receiving feedback, I prefer direct words, positive or negative instead of unnecessary complications. I'm open to change and would like to improve something if pointed out.

Finally, I enjoy working at nights, so you might catch me working late quite often. There's just a lot of peace to think and work.

## Questions?

Chances are high that I might have left out some important details, in which case, feel free to reach out and I'll update it as soon as possible.
